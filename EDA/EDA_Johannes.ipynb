But, to your point, I don't care whether the person who shows up to carry my father out of his burning house is a woman or a man as long as that person is physically up to the job. I would be very surprised if the feminist movement disagreed with that position, it being fundamental to the idea of equality. who no matter what they say will never believe that all men are rapists That viewpoint is held by a very small number of people - no-one was suggesting it here. ...and that i only want ot be with my children because I am too stupid to realised that i have been conditioned to do so. What I actually said was, if you accept that women want to be with their children more than men do, in general, that it is either a result of conditioning or biology. Neither of these positions is offensive to you; neither entails calling you stupid. People will demonise anything that appears to be holding extreme or unreasonable views... Call all men rapist and they will. Feminists are not demonised for calling men rapists. They are demonised for holding perfectly reasonable views. Although you may not agree with them, there is nothing unreasonable about saying that women and man should be treated equally. Men are criticised for not conforming to what is considered to be the traditional role for a man, and they daren't ever mention 'mens rights' . How that any different? It is not different. Why should anyone have to conform to other peoples' idea of what they should be like? I respect your position about being a mother and not wanting to pursue a career. Why should you not respect the position that a woman can have children and pursue a career? Why should you not respect the position that a man can be the primary caregiver just as easily as a woman can?  What caring roles are women being forced into that they don't want to do, be specific sweeping generalisations are very evasive. Again, you are misrepresenting what I said. Nobody is forced into a caring role. My issue is that you think women should accept that they are suited to caring roles and not to positions in influential spheres, e.g. law, banking, political office, neurosurgery, NASA etc. Women are being criticised by people like you for wanting only what they are entitled to.

I don't think the objectification of woman can possibly be a result of my actions. I don't think my biological make-up can possibly be a result of my actions. You need to be more specific, what kind of jobs? I employ 300 people and everyone doing the same job gets the same pay. I've already been specific on this point. I cited a 2010 survey, published on the BBC, that suggested that the pay gap for 'managerial' professions, even where it is the same job, is, on average, 10K between the man and the woman. I'm glad you pay everyone the same but the pay gap is actual, not imaginery. Can you tell me why? Because some people are too stupid to reason with. Period. I don't think this is stupid people. I have seen this argument eloquently expressed by people who I very much doubt are out gay-bashing while we're having this debate.

What is relevant is that women in general very often find themselves stereotyped into those roles as if, by not being caring or sexual, they are subverting the natural order of things. They are criticised for being vocal about womens' rights. They are criticised if they don't conform to other peoples' ideas of what it is to be a woman.  Surely it is just a case of everyone fighting over the same resources and the better qualified getting them? I'm not sure you have addressed my point here. Or anywhere else for that matter.

However I think it is a valid observation that, as a society, we are still in a position where many people assume that that person should and will be the woman. Your own argument supports this to some extent: none of your female friends wanted to leave their children. Some people would argue that this is a result of social conditioning: women have always been the main carer, so they feel they should still take on that role, despite the fact that they could return to work and their earning power means their husband could stay at home. Some people argue it is a biological issue: women are wired to want to care for their children personally.  I am simply pointing out that, whichever the true reason and whether or not you agree with quotas (I don't), women are almost inevitably going to continue to exercise less power at the highest level than men, unless the above changes. One way to change it is through the recognition that more women take time out on behalf of the couple to care for the children, and taking proactive steps to ensure that more of them are in top jobs.</td>\n",

It may be that we have reached a consensus, but for me, there are unanswered questions: Why are some women who point to the gender inequalities in our society defined as 'feminists' and accused of participating in a mass conspiracy against men? Why is a man still considered by many to be unable to bring up a child as well as a woman?  Why are men and women still paid different salaries for the same jobs? Why is equality of power in the home and the workplace for women - a perfectly legitimate demand - perceived by many men to be a threat of subordination? What is the 'femme sole' scam and why is it a suitable riposte to the point that the role of a woman has traditionally been defined as a caring and sexual one? Why is what is clearly a class issue (fewer skilled jobs in the economy and more educated, middle class people - men and women - occupying jobs that previously would have been occupied by working class people) being redefined as a gender issue?</td>\n",

However, even taking into account any innate biological reasons for women gravitating towards caring professions and men gravitating towards physical ones, the point remains: there are more men in professions where power is traditionally exercised.

What feminism seems to have turned into in modern Britain is essentially a women's special interest group which aims to promote women's interests, not equality.   You can argue this if you like. I don't think you can argue what several people have tried to argue: that feminism is an attempt to completely subjugate men. Defending your interests and victimising people do not necessarily add up to the same thing. ...the more militant ones definitely give this impression.I know this. However those who don't are still regularly told that this is their intention. Do I sound like a man-hater to you? I'm not. But because of my arguments today, I have been called a man-hating, emotionally unstable paranoid. That is what I am arguing is ridiculous. To me, it is a big issue. ...men are generally stronger and therefore clearly more suited to physically demanding jobs (builders, foresters, farmers and so on)... So the 'caring' jobs would be where I'd expect to see more women.  Non sequitur. Just because men are generally suited to physically demanding jobs, that doesn't mean women are more suited to caring jobs.

As many men on the Childrens' Act pointed out, a toothless law does not change the status quo. So, traditional male-dominated professions, like medicine for example, are now predominantly female. So in the past ten years or so, these entrenched disadvantages have proven to be anything but In one profession, yes. What about law, investment banking, politics? There have been many encouraging changes over the last 30 years but it is a slow process and, at the moment, the professions where people tend to accumulate the most wealth (power) and influence (power) remain dominated by men. That's anecdotal, but it shows that these disadvantages are not entrenched, times can and will change. Of course and again, I have conceded this several times. However what I was objecting to was posters condemning women for describing the status quo and for misrepresenting their intentions in doing so. Your best friend is still the exception, not the norm.

To answer your question (although I have done this already): although most women now work, they still earn less than men for doing the same jobs. Although most women work, they still shoulder the majority of childcare and they still do most of the housework. Although many women go to university, the number who enter the 'traditional', male-dominated professions is paltry. Although men and women decide to have children together, women are still disadvantaged in the workplace by the necessity to take long periods off work to care for children. These are real things.

There is still a lot of gender inequality out there which, depending on how you like to use language, you could characterise as 'oppression' (although I don't think anyone has actually said that). Women still earn less than men for the same jobs, there are still fewer women in traditionally prestigious jobs (law, banking, surgery etc.), there is still a culture that seems to accept women being objectified and defined on the basis of their sexual attractivness.

Having worked in the oil industry for over thirty years my experience is that at the start most women employees were typists, secretaries or dolly bird pa's. In the past 15 - 20 years it however has moved from a grudging acceptance to an almost religious zeal to get women into the industry and move them up the ladder to show that we are a diverse company. In one of the dept's I worked in about 10 years ago I had a female boss who had a regular Friday lunchtime women empowerment meeting with all the women who also worked in the dept. No men allowed and no similar sessions for men either, but that of course was not seen as being discrimatory when of course it so obviously was. As to the boardroom the truth remains that whilst there may be roughly the same numbers of men and women at the start of their careers aiming for such posts the fact that some 80% of women take time off for childbirth etc., does damage their career prospects. It would be unfair if it didn't! Coupled to the fact that yes there was still much discrimination up until the last 15 - 20 years and it's not great surprise. We will see more women in boardrooms and top jobs, but it will never be 50%.

Who has the best life chances in our society - the white working-class male, or the white public-school educated female? I suggest the latter.  I suggest class quotas in boardrooms- with a maximum 10 per cent public school educated roughly in line with society (think it's 7 per cent so I'm being generous). As an interim measure I'll allow 25 per cent.  What about it - or would this be too much equality? Never going to happen, I'm pretty certain if you went into the Guardian offices, and asked everyone with a state education to put their hands up, the only people who would are the cleaners. ] Recommended. I'm afraid Persianwar has totally misunderstood the purpose of quotas and Political Correctness if he thinks its about 'equality' or 'fairness'. Quotas for example are a great method for increasing upper middle class privilege in exactly the way you describe while at the same time being able to pretend to be for social equality.

       "0   So you are saying that the demonisation of feminists is their own fault? It's not my fault. But, to your point, I don't care whether the person who shows up to carry my father out of his burning house is a woman or a man as long as that person is physically up to the job. I would be very surprised if the feminist movement disagreed with that position, it being fundamental to the idea of equality. who no matter what they say will never believe that all men are rapists That viewpoint is held by a very small number of people - no-one was suggesting it here. ...and that i only want ot be with my children because I am too stupid to realised that i have been conditioned to do so. What I actually said was, if you accept that women want to be with their children more than men do, in general, that it is either a result of conditioning or biology. Neither of these positions is offensive to you; neither entails calling you stupid. People will demonise anything that appears to be holding extreme or unreasonable views... Call all men rapist and they will. Feminists are not demonised for calling men rapists. They are demonised for holding perfectly reasonable views. Although you may not agree with them, there is nothing unreasonable about saying that women and man should be treated equally. Men are criticised for not conforming to what is considered to be the traditional role for a man, and they daren't ever mention 'mens rights' . How that any different? It is not different. Why should anyone have to conform to other peoples' idea of what they should be like? I respect your position about being a mother and not wanting to pursue a career. Why should you not respect the position that a woman can have children and pursue a career? Why should you not respect the position that a man can be the primary caregiver just as easily as a woman can?  What caring roles are women being forced into that they don't want to do, be specific sweeping generalisations are very evasive. Again, you are misrepresenting what I said. Nobody is forced into a caring role. My issue is that you think women should accept that they are suited to caring roles and not to positions in influential spheres, e.g. law, banking, political office, neurosurgery, NASA etc. Women are being criticised by people like you for wanting only what they are entitled to. That is my problem.   \n",
       "1   So you are explicitly saying that it is not ok for men to raise children and for women to perform top jobs, or for women to have children and have, for example, a nanny, spending as much time with their children as the father does?

However it is entirely unreasonable to suggest that, because as a woman I may or may not be wired to want to care for my children, I should give up the notion of having a career as well. That is like something out of the dark ages. I honestly thought we had come further than that and there was a degree of consensus around things like maternity leave/pay. Clearly I was wrong. That does not mean you answered any of my questions by the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3   Because some of the points that they raise are as a result of their own actions and they refuse to take responsibility for it. Such as what? I don't think that I, as a woman - whether or not you could call me a feminist - could possibly be influential enough for the pay gap to be a result of my actions. I don't think the objectification of woman can possibly be a result of my actions. I don't think my biological make-up can possibly be a result of my actions. You need to be more specific, what kind of jobs? I employ 300 people and everyone doing the same job gets the same pay. I've already been specific on this point. I cited a 2010 survey, published on the BBC, that suggested that the pay gap for 'managerial' professions, even where it is the same job, is, on average, 10K between the man and the woman. I'm glad you pay everyone the same but the pay gap is actual, not imaginery. Can you tell me why? Because some people are too stupid to reason with. Period. I don't think this is stupid people. I have seen this argument eloquently expressed by people who I very much doubt are out gay-bashing while we're having this debate. This isn't a couple of unreasonable people; this is many people - mostly men - demonising feminists. Regardless of whether they are right or wrong, can you explain why they hold this view? I havent got a problem with being see in that way, I am a caring and sexual person. Aren't you? I don't think it relevant whether you or I are caring or sexual. What is relevant is that women in general very often find themselves stereotyped into those roles as if, by not being caring or sexual, they are subverting the natural order of things. They are criticised for being vocal about womens' rights. They are criticised if they don't conform to other peoples' ideas of what it is to be a woman.  Surely it is just a case of everyone fighting over the same resources and the better qualified getting them? I'm not sure you have addressed my point here. Or anywhere else for that matter. I find you very evasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4   I am not missing the point. I am not criticising your decisions; it is entirely valid for any individual woman to want to stay at home with her children.  However I think it is a valid observation that, as a society, we are still in a position where many people assume that that person should and will be the woman. Your own argument supports this to some extent: none of your female friends wanted to leave their children. Some people would argue that this is a result of social conditioning: women have always been the main carer, so they feel they should still take on that role, despite the fact that they could return to work and their earning power means their husband could stay at home. Some people argue it is a biological issue: women are wired to want to care for their children personally.  I am simply pointing out that, whichever the true reason and whether or not you agree with quotas (I don't), women are almost inevitably going to continue to exercise less power at the highest level than men, unless the above changes. One way to change it is through the recognition that more women take time out on behalf of the couple to care for the children, and taking proactive steps to ensure that more of them are in top jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "5   It might be helpful for me to summarise the things I still wonder about, based on some of the points that have been raised in the thread. It may be that we have reached a consensus, but for me, there are unanswered questions: Why are some women who point to the gender inequalities in our society defined as 'feminists' and accused of participating in a mass conspiracy against men? Why is a man still considered by many to be unable to bring up a child as well as a woman?  Why are men and women still paid different salaries for the same jobs? Why is equality of power in the home and the workplace for women - a perfectly legitimate demand - perceived by many men to be a threat of subordination? What is the 'femme sole' scam and why is it a suitable riposte to the point that the role of a woman has traditionally been defined as a caring and sexual one? Why is what is clearly a class issue (fewer skilled jobs in the economy and more educated, middle class people - men and women - occupying jobs that previously would have been occupied by working class people) being redefined as a gender issue?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Disgusting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "7   Why should it be down to to how much women want to succeed, when it's generally a joint decision to have a baby and a joint decision for the woman to provide the majority of the care. As for a woman's duty to be married, have kids and look after children well, I think that assumption is where the inequalities I have been describing emerged from in the first place. Men are perfectly able to look after children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "8   I know they can do that but the consensus we seem to have come to as a society is that a) it is good for someone to be at home with the child for the first 6 months to a year and b) it is good for a baby to be fed on breast milk. The only point I'm making is that, in the majority of cases, the person couples decide should perform the caring role is the woman. If society changes to the point that there are a majority of men doing the caring, great; I would say you could argue the opposite in terms of the level to which they deserve a helping hand. This is just the reality of the society we live in now. As I have said before, I don't actually agree with quotas; I'm not a fan or opposed to them particularly.

When a woman gets pregnant on her own (or without the consent of her partner), I'll agree with you: currently, she is paying a greater career price for what both men and women want and need equally. I said I can argue, by the way - not that this is my core argument. Let's not get distracted here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "12  It's only a non-sequitur because you ellipsised out the connection!  No, you made a vague reference to differences between the male and female brains; you made no explicit link between women and caring professions. I don't entirely disagree; there probably are demonstrable differences between the male and female brain. I am not sure they are as well established as you make out, i.e. I am probably more logical than emotional and there are many men who have been 'conditioned' to hide their emotions for fear of not seeming masculine enough.  However, even taking into account any innate biological reasons for women gravitating towards caring professions and men gravitating towards physical ones, the point remains: there are more men in professions where power is traditionally exercised. This can have negative consequences for womens' ability to represent themselves in the corridors of power. It is not wrong for a feminist (or any woman or any man) to draw attention to this reality. It does not constitute an attack on men for them to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "13  But why does tradition dominate? Is it social norms and tradition, or is there actually a real reason relating to for example nuturing instincts or hormone balances?  I don't know. I don't care. I am simply saying that it is not inaccurate, contemptible or a deliberate attempt to subjugate men for women to point it out. However, the logical next step in terms of your question is probably to say it is a) an instinctive thing b) a social thing or c) a mix of the two. If it's A, then you can more easily argue that women deserve an artificial helping hand to fulfil their career potential. If it's B or C, then it will probably change in time anyway, if the feminists get their way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "14  In general I would agree with you. However the reality is that tradition tends to predominate: women do take full maternity leave (a year, usually) and there is an impact on their career. This can, should and probably will change but at the moment, the impact on the woman is greater than it is on the man in the majority of cases.  There is also the softer side of being a woman in terms of its impact on career development: I have spoken to more than one boss (male and female) who would prefer not to hire a woman in her mid-twenties to late thirties, just in case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "15  My buttons have been pushed so much today, I don't think it will bother me :) However I think I know what you mean: women can exercise power informally more effectively than they tend to exercise power formally. This argument has some merit but it doesn't invalidate my argument, or that of the feminists. Ultimately, you can't argue that the ability to influence 'behind the scenes' is as important to the outcomes as the ability to exercise power in bright daylight.  You should really cite examples though, or refrain from making the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "16  [ since power is traditionally exercised in economic and political, rather than social terms ] see, i think this is highly relevant. power is traditionally measured in economic / political terms, but it's important not to fall into the very modern trap of omitting that which can't be measured from your analysis in the interests of convenience. i'd argue that the more nebulous social forms of power have more of an impact on most people's self esteem, sense of agency, quality of life etc. maybe if the vast majority of people weren't so excluded from the overt, codified power structures you're talking about it would be different. i'm loath to cite examples as people's buttons tend to get pushed (q.v. Catherine Hakim). i do think we need a real synthesis between the narcissisticly polarised viewpoints that get thrown around but i can't see it happening any time soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "19  Is anyone denying that? Yes! There are people saying there is no inequality, and people saying that women have subjugated men. I don't think this is totally false. What feminism seems to have turned into in modern Britain is essentially a women's special interest group which aims to promote women's interests, not equality.   You can argue this if you like. I don't think you can argue what several people have tried to argue: that feminism is an attempt to completely subjugate men. Defending your interests and victimising people do not necessarily add up to the same thing. ...the more militant ones definitely give this impression.I know this. However those who don't are still regularly told that this is their intention. Do I sound like a man-hater to you? I'm not. But because of my arguments today, I have been called a man-hating, emotionally unstable paranoid. That is what I am arguing is ridiculous. To me, it is a big issue. ...men are generally stronger and therefore clearly more suited to physically demanding jobs (builders, foresters, farmers and so on)... So the 'caring' jobs would be where I'd expect to see more women.  Non sequitur. Just because men are generally suited to physically demanding jobs, that doesn't mean women are more suited to caring jobs. And in terms of the 'power-broker' jobs I am actually talking about, there is no difference I can think of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "20  You seem to be making my points for me. If a couple want to have children, which many naturally do, it being the only way to propagate the race, it will impact more on the womans' career than the man's. This being a joint decision, this seems unfair. It leads to inequalities of outcome.  That's all I'm saying.

       "21  That's terrible, they should pass a law prohibiting that. Oh wait, they did, 42 years ago. I'm not ignorant of the law, but I think you know that it is widely flouted in practice. As many men on the Childrens' Act pointed out, a toothless law does not change the status quo. So, traditional male-dominated professions, like medicine for example, are now predominantly female. So in the past ten years or so, these entrenched disadvantages have proven to be anything but In one profession, yes. What about law, investment banking, politics? There have been many encouraging changes over the last 30 years but it is a slow process and, at the moment, the professions where people tend to accumulate the most wealth (power) and influence (power) remain dominated by men. That's anecdotal, but it shows that these disadvantages are not entrenched, times can and will change. Of course and again, I have conceded this several times. However what I was objecting to was posters condemning women for describing the status quo and for misrepresenting their intentions in doing so. Your best friend is still the exception, not the norm. So let's see them. - In 2010, the BBC estimated that male managers are, on average, paid £10K more than female counterparts.- They estimated that the gender pay gap would, at this rate, close in 2067- Female MPs make up 21% of the UK parliament- One in 7 fathers are the primary carers for their children. I'm sure these aren't bullet-proof stats but you get the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "22  Ok, can you give me some generalised examples? I don't think we are at polar ends of this debate; I have never said that there are not advantages to being female, in terms of how society is currently structured. However, since power is traditionally exercised in economic and political, rather than social terms, I think it is fair to say that the obstacles women face in the workplace are real obstacles to equality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "23  whoah, ok, rewind. i've never met you so i'm not talking about you personally. all i'm saying is:  1) there are some perks to being female that you might be taking for granted (just as men tend to take their privileges for granted). and 2) it's kind of absurd to try and add up all these factors to work out which gender has it easier, as people don't all want the same things. i'll grant that if you restrict the context to climbing the career ladder as an elite professional/executive, women currently face more obstacles, but there's more to life than work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "25  Do you know what, although I disagree with you, that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion. There is no obligation on any woman to define herself as a 'feminist'; what I object to is being defined as a 'feminist' by someone else, and that term being loaded with additional meaning, for example when I was called a 'man-hating, emotionally unstable paranod' on the thread this afternoon, for pointing out what I pointed out to you about the 'Daves' of this world.  To answer your question (although I have done this already): although most women now work, they still earn less than men for doing the same jobs. Although most women work, they still shoulder the majority of childcare and they still do most of the housework. Although many women go to university, the number who enter the 'traditional', male-dominated professions is paltry. Although men and women decide to have children together, women are still disadvantaged in the workplace by the necessity to take long periods off work to care for children. These are real things. I am not saying there are not aspects of our society that benefit women. I'm not burning my bra here. The point I am making is simple and it is backed up by statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "27  Perhaps? Do you think that or not? I am not looking for finger in the air theories, I am looking for an actual hypothesis that might answer my question. You may say this is about class, but in your post you blame only the women for what you are trying to define as a class problem. I will ask again: why are women being scapegoated (middle class women taking the opportunities etc.)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "28  Again, this is interesting, because it is certainly true that they are less oppressed than they used to be. However it seems to be that a) the closer we move towards equal power between the sexes (as a general rule) the more afraid and defensive men get. They seem to feel as though they are gazing into the abyss in some ways, and I am interested in why they would feel like that. However, I don't think you can defend either the degree of hostility (insults, a breathtakingly inaccurate and offensive view of feminists, mass generalisations about womens' intentions towards men) on that basis, or actually the premise itself. There is still a lot of gender inequality out there which, depending on how you like to use language, you could characterise as 'oppression' (although I don't think anyone has actually said that). Women still earn less than men for the same jobs, there are still fewer women in traditionally prestigious jobs (law, banking, surgery etc.), there is still a culture that seems to accept women being objectified and defined on the basis of their sexual attractivness. As a woman, you can't go on a night out without someone thinking it's ok to proposition you for sex or grab you round the waist while you're dancing: if you're not keen, you're 'frigid' or 'a lesbian.' Women still do the majority of the domestic work, including childcare, even when both partners are working. Are any of these things untrue?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "74  Agree with many posters that is it moslty a class thing. The complaint is always about there not being enough women in the boardroom, not about how many women are in what we might term normal jobs, or that there are still many jobs that are still seen as being women only. Having worked in the oil industry for over thirty years my experience is that at the start most women employees were typists, secretaries or dolly bird pa's. In the past 15 - 20 years it however has moved from a grudging acceptance to an almost religious zeal to get women into the industry and move them up the ladder to show that we are a diverse company. In one of the dept's I worked in about 10 years ago I had a female boss who had a regular Friday lunchtime women empowerment meeting with all the women who also worked in the dept. No men allowed and no similar sessions for men either, but that of course was not seen as being discrimatory when of course it so obviously was. As to the boardroom the truth remains that whilst there may be roughly the same numbers of men and women at the start of their careers aiming for such posts the fact that some 80% of women take time off for childbirth etc., does damage their career prospects. It would be unfair if it didn't! Coupled to the fact that yes there was still much discrimination up until the last 15 - 20 years and it's not great surprise. We will see more women in boardrooms and top jobs, but it will never be 50%. And, unless we start selecting people on skills and ability rather then gender then any advancement of women is an ilusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "75  women have babies and therefore take all the childcare responsibilities...inequality at work follows Indeed. However, there is absolutely no reason why men should not be the primary childcarers, and if they were, men would no doubt suffer from inequality at work. I repeat there is no reason why men should not be the primary childcarers so why aren't they, more often?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "77  If you accept that Lehman Sisters would not have collapsed and been a very well run, risk averse institution, then clearly you accept that women are inherently better at some jobs than men. For this to be correct, then the opposite must also be true - ie there must be some jobs at which men are better than women. What jobs are they then? Why do we never hear about these jobs?

       "81  [ Response to Persianwar, 10 February 2012 1:09AM  If we're going to go for quotas then let's do it properly. Who has the best life chances in our society - the white working-class male, or the white public-school educated female? I suggest the latter.  I suggest class quotas in boardrooms- with a maximum 10 per cent public school educated roughly in line with society (think it's 7 per cent so I'm being generous). As an interim measure I'll allow 25 per cent.  What about it - or would this be too much equality? Never going to happen, I'm pretty certain if you went into the Guardian offices, and asked everyone with a state education to put their hands up, the only people who would are the cleaners. ] Recommended. I'm afraid Persianwar has totally misunderstood the purpose of quotas and Political Correctness if he thinks its about 'equality' or 'fairness'. Quotas for example are a great method for increasing upper middle class privilege in exactly the way you describe while at the same time being able to pretend to be for social equality. People who call for quotas based on class have been fooled by the rhetoric.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "82  What can't be forgotten in this is that a major factor in making men more competitive that women is women themselves.

I think its wrong to underestimate the impact this factor has.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "83  Well, this is a first. The Guardy strikes back (in a way other than the good ol' moderators' attack). I am being blocked from recommending a single post. The cursor draws a blank if I try. It does n't register. No action.

       "87  I used to work at a very high pressure company in the city. Many of my colleagues have now gone on to be chief executives of major organisations, government departments and so on - both men and women. The thing they are seem to share is utter dedication to their work - the first, last and only priority. Realising that this was what I'd have to do if I wanted that life, and realising that life also meant being a drop in dad with minimal involvement in my family's life - I decided that I liked the sound of enough better than the sound of more. So, twenty years later. I have a good home life, and still on my first marriage and am best mates with my child. None of my high flying ex-colleagues, male or female, can say the same. I hope satisfaction in their work and achievements (which are both considerable and seriously impressive) is sufficient compensation. I suppose I am saying that the barriers are rapidly coming down but, after ability, the final criteria for big time success in business is always going to be total dedication, and the marginalising of anything that distracts from the job.

       "89  Very good point. So many women choose to forego great careers for the domestic life. I even had a debate with a friend about this. She said a successful career woman is never as successful as a mother. Then she went on to criticise Michelle Mone for chasing success and neglecting her marriage. I asked her why she is choosing to single out Michelle and not the countless men who make the same sacrifice. She said it's because it's a woman's duty to be married, have kids and look after her children. Working women are ruining society, she said. As you said, it's all down to just how much women want to succeed and whether or not they are willing to make the sacrifices that success usually requires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "90  I, personally, do not want handouts. I don't want to get a job simply because of a quota or because somebody feels guilty or has been forced to. I hate the victim mentality the both women and minorities have. (I might just add that I am a woman and a minority.) I think it cheapens our value substantially, we need to prove our worth. Having said that, I think the problem starts way before women even enter the workforce or decide on a career. I only have to look at my own childhood and my friends' children to see the problem. Little girls are given messages that are very different to little boys. My friend gifted her daughter a kitchen set for her 3rd birthday. A kitchen set? Really? We're given dolls, mirrors and fake babies while men are given 'action' men, cars (that go somewhere), lego sets and the lot. Something is wrong with this, I won't expand much further as I will go on and on, but it's not harmless fun. This is a serious issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "92  [ If we're going to go for quotas then let's do it properly. Who has the best life chances in our society - the white working-class male, or the white public-school educated female? I suggest the latter. I suggest class quotas in boardrooms- with a maximum 10 per cent public school educated roughly in line with society (think it's 7 per cent so I'm being generous). As an interim measure I'll allow 25 per cent. What about it - or would this be too much equality? ] Never going to happen, I'm pretty certain if you went into the Guardian offices, and asked everyone with a state education to put their hands up, the only people who would are the cleaners. The Guardian women who write in this section are mainly privately educated and come from privillegde backgrounds. They fight tooth and nail to prove that this country is deeply sexist, when it isn't, because they enjoy playing the victim.  If this country is sexist, then the Guardian women have exceeded expectations, they have got their position in life while fighing men trying to hold them down. The reality, that they are a bunch of rich girls who have got where they are because mummy and daddy bought them the best education, provided them with lots of useful contacts, and they could afford to be interns in London.

       "94  It needs to be stated (again) that competent women understanding the need to be be there for their children 24 / 7 diminishes the desire to give what it takes to live at the top. Time devoted to company, is time away from family, and such women, or some, will be aware of creating emotional problems for their children, probably having friends, with children in therapy. In the mother daughter relationship, perception (projection) is often skewed by a mother not constrained by money, choosing to be away from the children. Sometimes it has no noticeable effect, but enough women carry this exclusion through life, and their numbers are not miniscule. A woman is conditioned this way, as men are not.Sometimes on Bear Grylls, when, at night feeling a little miserable, he often refers to his family when times are tough, and for many despite quotas and agendas, family is too important.

       "0        So you are saying that the demonisation of feminists is their own fault? It's not my fault. But, to your point, I don't care whether the person who shows up to carry my father out of his burning house is a woman or a man as long as that person is physically up to the job. I would be very surprised if the feminist movement disagreed with that position, it being fundamental to the idea of equality. who no matter what they say will never believe that all men are rapists That viewpoint is held by a very small number of people - no-one was suggesting it here. ...and that i only want ot be with my children because I am too stupid to realised that i have been conditioned to do so. What I actually said was, if you accept that women want to be with their children more than men do, in general, that it is either a result of conditioning or biology. Neither of these positions is offensive to you; neither entails calling you stupid. People will demonise anything that appears to be holding extreme or unreasonable views... Call all men rapist and they will. Feminists are not demonised for calling men rapists. They are demonised for holding perfectly reasonable views. Although you may not agree with them, there is nothing unreasonable about saying that women and man should be treated equally. Men are criticised for not conforming to what is considered to be the traditional role for a man, and they daren't ever mention 'mens rights' . How that any different? It is not different. Why should anyone have to conform to other peoples' idea of what they should be like? I respect your position about being a mother and not wanting to pursue a career. Why should you not respect the position that a woman can have children and pursue a career? Why should you not respect the position that a man can be the primary caregiver just as easily as a woman can?  What caring roles are women being forced into that they don't want to do, be specific sweeping generalisations are very evasive. Again, you are misrepresenting what I said. Nobody is forced into a caring role. My issue is that you think women should accept that they are suited to caring roles and not to positions in influential spheres, e.g. law, banking, political office, neurosurgery, NASA etc. Women are being criticised by people like you for wanting only what they are entitled to. That is my problem.\n",
       "1        So you are explicitly saying that it is not ok for men to raise children and for women to perform top jobs, or for women to have children and have, for example, a nanny, spending as much time with their children as the father does?

       "2        So we have given up on the reasoned debate then? I do not talk about children like I am talking about doing the dishes. However it is entirely unreasonable to suggest that, because as a woman I may or may not be wired to want to care for my children, I should give up the notion of having a career as well. That is like something out of the dark ages. I honestly thought we had come further than that and there was a degree of consensus around things like maternity leave/pay. Clearly I was wrong.

       "3        Because some of the points that they raise are as a result of their own actions and they refuse to take responsibility for it. Such as what? I don't think that I, as a woman - whether or not you could call me a feminist - could possibly be influential enough for the pay gap to be a result of my actions. I don't think the objectification of woman can possibly be a result of my actions. I don't think my biological make-up can possibly be a result of my actions. You need to be more specific, what kind of jobs? I employ 300 people and everyone doing the same job gets the same pay. I've already been specific on this point. I cited a 2010 survey, published on the BBC, that suggested that the pay gap for 'managerial' professions, even where it is the same job, is, on average, 10K between the man and the woman. I'm glad you pay everyone the same but the pay gap is actual, not imaginery. Can you tell me why? Because some people are too stupid to reason with. Period. I don't think this is stupid people. I have seen this argument eloquently expressed by people who I very much doubt are out gay-bashing while we're having this debate. This isn't a couple of unreasonable people; this is many people - mostly men - demonising feminists. Regardless of whether they are right or wrong, can you explain why they hold this view? I havent got a problem with being see in that way, I am a caring and sexual person. Aren't you? I don't think it relevant whether you or I are caring or sexual. What is relevant is that women in general very often find themselves stereotyped into those roles as if, by not being caring or sexual, they are subverting the natural order of things. They are criticised for being vocal about womens' rights. They are criticised if they don't conform to other peoples' ideas of what it is to be a woman.  Surely it is just a case of everyone fighting over the same resources and the better qualified getting them? I'm not sure you have addressed my point here. Or anywhere else for that matter. I find you very evasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "4        I am not missing the point. I am not criticising your decisions; it is entirely valid for any individual woman to want to stay at home with her children.  However I think it is a valid observation that, as a society, we are still in a position where many people assume that that person should and will be the woman. Your own argument supports this to some extent: none of your female friends wanted to leave their children. Some people would argue that this is a result of social conditioning: women have always been the main carer, so they feel they should still take on that role, despite the fact that they could return to work and their earning power means their husband could stay at home. Some people argue it is a biological issue: women are wired to want to care for their children personally.  I am simply pointing out that, whichever the true reason and whether or not you agree with quotas (I don't), women are almost inevitably going to continue to exercise less power at the highest level than men, unless the above changes. One way to change it is through the recognition that more women take time out on behalf of the couple to care for the children, and taking proactive steps to ensure that more of them are in top jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "5        It might be helpful for me to summarise the things I still wonder about, based on some of the points that have been raised in the thread. It may be that we have reached a consensus, but for me, there are unanswered questions: Why are some women who point to the gender inequalities in our society defined as 'feminists' and accused of participating in a mass conspiracy against men? Why is a man still considered by many to be unable to bring up a child as well as a woman?  Why are men and women still paid different salaries for the same jobs? Why is equality of power in the home and the workplace for women - a perfectly legitimate demand - perceived by many men to be a threat of subordination? What is the 'femme sole' scam and why is it a suitable riposte to the point that the role of a woman has traditionally been defined as a caring and sexual one? Why is what is clearly a class issue (fewer skilled jobs in the economy and more educated, middle class people - men and women - occupying jobs that previously would have been occupied by working class people) being redefined as a gender issue?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "7        Why should it be down to to how much women want to succeed, when it's generally a joint decision to have a baby and a joint decision for the woman to provide the majority of the care. As for a woman's duty to be married, have kids and look after children well, I think that assumption is where the inequalities I have been describing emerged from in the first place. Men are perfectly able to look after children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "8        I know they can do that but the consensus we seem to have come to as a society is that a) it is good for someone to be at home with the child for the first 6 months to a year and b) it is good for a baby to be fed on breast milk. The only point I'm making is that, in the majority of cases, the person couples decide should perform the caring role is the woman. If society changes to the point that there are a majority of men doing the caring, great; I would say you could argue the opposite in terms of the level to which they deserve a helping hand. This is just the reality of the society we live in now. As I have said before, I don't actually agree with quotas; I'm not a fan or opposed to them particularly.

When a woman gets pregnant on her own (or without the consent of her partner), I'll agree with you: currently, she is paying a greater career price for what both men and women want and need equally. I said I can argue, by the way - not that this is my core argument. Let's not get distracted here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "12       It's only a non-sequitur because you ellipsised out the connection!  No, you made a vague reference to differences between the male and female brains; you made no explicit link between women and caring professions. I don't entirely disagree; there probably are demonstrable differences between the male and female brain. I am not sure they are as well established as you make out, i.e. I am probably more logical than emotional and there are many men who have been 'conditioned' to hide their emotions for fear of not seeming masculine enough.  However, even taking into account any innate biological reasons for women gravitating towards caring professions and men gravitating towards physical ones, the point remains: there are more men in professions where power is traditionally exercised. This can have negative consequences for womens' ability to represent themselves in the corridors of power. It is not wrong for a feminist (or any woman or any man) to draw attention to this reality. It does not constitute an attack on men for them to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "13       But why does tradition dominate? Is it social norms and tradition, or is there actually a real reason relating to for example nuturing instincts or hormone balances?  I don't know. I don't care. I am simply saying that it is not inaccurate, contemptible or a deliberate attempt to subjugate men for women to point it out. However, the logical next step in terms of your question is probably to say it is a) an instinctive thing b) a social thing or c) a mix of the two. If it's A, then you can more easily argue that women deserve an artificial helping hand to fulfil their career potential. If it's B or C, then it will probably change in time anyway, if the feminists get their way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "14       In general I would agree with you. However the reality is that tradition tends to predominate: women do take full maternity leave (a year, usually) and there is an impact on their career. This can, should and probably will change but at the moment, the impact on the woman is greater than it is on the man in the majority of cases.  There is also the softer side of being a woman in terms of its impact on career development: I have spoken to more than one boss (male and female) who would prefer not to hire a woman in her mid-twenties to late thirties, just in case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "15       My buttons have been pushed so much today, I don't think it will bother me :) However I think I know what you mean: women can exercise power informally more effectively than they tend to exercise power formally. This argument has some merit but it doesn't invalidate my argument, or that of the feminists. Ultimately, you can't argue that the ability to influence 'behind the scenes' is as important to the outcomes as the ability to exercise power in bright daylight.  You should really cite examples though, or refrain from making the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "16       [ since power is traditionally exercised in economic and political, rather than social terms ] see, i think this is highly relevant. power is traditionally measured in economic / political terms, but it's important not to fall into the very modern trap of omitting that which can't be measured from your analysis in the interests of convenience. i'd argue that the more nebulous social forms of power have more of an impact on most people's self esteem, sense of agency, quality of life etc. maybe if the vast majority of people weren't so excluded from the overt, codified power structures you're talking about it would be different. i'm loath to cite examples as people's buttons tend to get pushed (q.v. Catherine Hakim). i do think we need a real synthesis between the narcissisticly polarised viewpoints that get thrown around but i can't see it happening any time soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "19       Is anyone denying that? Yes! There are people saying there is no inequality, and people saying that women have subjugated men. I don't think this is totally false. What feminism seems to have turned into in modern Britain is essentially a women's special interest group which aims to promote women's interests, not equality.   You can argue this if you like. I don't think you can argue what several people have tried to argue: that feminism is an attempt to completely subjugate men. Defending your interests and victimising people do not necessarily add up to the same thing. ...the more militant ones definitely give this impression.I know this. However those who don't are still regularly told that this is their intention. Do I sound like a man-hater to you? I'm not. But because of my arguments today, I have been called a man-hating, emotionally unstable paranoid. That is what I am arguing is ridiculous. To me, it is a big issue. ...men are generally stronger and therefore clearly more suited to physically demanding jobs (builders, foresters, farmers and so on)... So the 'caring' jobs would be where I'd expect to see more women.  Non sequitur. Just because men are generally suited to physically demanding jobs, that doesn't mean women are more suited to caring jobs. And in terms of the 'power-broker' jobs I am actually talking about, there is no difference I can think of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "20       You seem to be making my points for me. If a couple want to have children, which many naturally do, it being the only way to propagate the race, it will impact more on the womans' career than the man's. This being a joint decision, this seems unfair. It leads to inequalities of outcome.  That's all I'm saying. I am not even agreeing with quotas - read my whole post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "21       That's terrible, they should pass a law prohibiting that. Oh wait, they did, 42 years ago. I'm not ignorant of the law, but I think you know that it is widely flouted in practice. As many men on the Childrens' Act pointed out, a toothless law does not change the status quo. So, traditional male-dominated professions, like medicine for example, are now predominantly female. So in the past ten years or so, these entrenched disadvantages have proven to be anything but In one profession, yes. What about law, investment banking, politics? There have been many encouraging changes over the last 30 years but it is a slow process and, at the moment, the professions where people tend to accumulate the most wealth (power) and influence (power) remain dominated by men. That's anecdotal, but it shows that these disadvantages are not entrenched, times can and will change. Of course and again, I have conceded this several times. However what I was objecting to was posters condemning women for describing the status quo and for misrepresenting their intentions in doing so. Your best friend is still the exception, not the norm. So let's see them. - In 2010, the BBC estimated that male managers are, on average, paid £10K more than female counterparts.- They estimated that the gender pay gap would, at this rate, close in 2067- Female MPs make up 21% of the UK parliament- One in 7 fathers are the primary carers for their children. I'm sure these aren't bullet-proof stats but you get the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "22       Ok, can you give me some generalised examples? I don't think we are at polar ends of this debate; I have never said that there are not advantages to being female, in terms of how society is currently structured. However, since power is traditionally exercised in economic and political, rather than social terms, I think it is fair to say that the obstacles women face in the workplace are real obstacles to equality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "23       whoah, ok, rewind. i've never met you so i'm not talking about you personally. all i'm saying is:  1) there are some perks to being female that you might be taking for granted (just as men tend to take their privileges for granted). and 2) it's kind of absurd to try and add up all these factors to work out which gender has it easier, as people don't all want the same things. i'll grant that if you restrict the context to climbing the career ladder as an elite professional/executive, women currently face more obstacles, but there's more to life than work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "25       Do you know what, although I disagree with you, that's fine. You are entitled to your opinion. There is no obligation on any woman to define herself as a 'feminist'; what I object to is being defined as a 'feminist' by someone else, and that term being loaded with additional meaning, for example when I was called a 'man-hating, emotionally unstable paranod' on the thread this afternoon, for pointing out what I pointed out to you about the 'Daves' of this world.  To answer your question (although I have done this already): although most women now work, they still earn less than men for doing the same jobs. Although most women work, they still shoulder the majority of childcare and they still do most of the housework. Although many women go to university, the number who enter the 'traditional', male-dominated professions is paltry. Although men and women decide to have children together, women are still disadvantaged in the workplace by the necessity to take long periods off work to care for children. These are real things. I am not saying there are not aspects of our society that benefit women. I'm not burning my bra here. The point I am making is simple and it is backed up by statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "27       Perhaps? Do you think that or not? I am not looking for finger in the air theories, I am looking for an actual hypothesis that might answer my question. You may say this is about class, but in your post you blame only the women for what you are trying to define as a class problem.

       "28       Again, this is interesting, because it is certainly true that they are less oppressed than they used to be. However it seems to be that a) the closer we move towards equal power between the sexes (as a general rule) the more afraid and defensive men get. They seem to feel as though they are gazing into the abyss in some ways, and I am interested in why they would feel like that. However, I don't think you can defend either the degree of hostility (insults, a breathtakingly inaccurate and offensive view of feminists, mass generalisations about womens' intentions towards men) on that basis, or actually the premise itself. There is still a lot of gender inequality out there which, depending on how you like to use language, you could characterise as 'oppression' (although I don't think anyone has actually said that). Women still earn less than men for the same jobs, there are still fewer women in traditionally prestigious jobs (law, banking, surgery etc.), there is still a culture that seems to accept women being objectified and defined on the basis of their sexual attractivness. As a woman, you can't go on a night out without someone thinking it's ok to proposition you for sex or grab you round the waist while you're dancing: if you're not keen, you're 'frigid' or 'a lesbian.' Women still do the majority of the domestic work, including childcare, even when both partners are working. Are any of these things untrue?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "99976    I've come to the conclusion that the internet as a whole is a negative force and instead of uniting us in the unparalleled means of communication it provides it has divided us into tribes as never before. The biggest problem is that it allows idiots on all sides of the political spectrum to unite and for the first time in human history to give idiots a voice, and with each new internet 'outrage' (e.g. a scientist wearing a Hawaiian shirt while giving at interview) people become more ingrained in their particular tribe. Thanks to the internet people no longer have a shared collective media consumption experience as once provided say by the BBC and increasingly visit websites that reaffirm what they already feel. This only serves to fester division further. How it ends, I don't know, but the divisions we're seeing I imagine will only get more ingrained and the power of the internet is central to this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "99977    It's a very relevant article to the current human condition. The analogy with the alcoholic is spot-on. The idea of physical boundaries, of checking in phones prior to attending a dinner, is a worthwhile challenge. (I have the suspicion that I would be told to get lost if I tried it at home.)  In response to the relentlessness of advertising, I notice an increased ability to sift, to pay no attention, to not notice. Information is mostly deleted or passed over with recognition. If asked about it later...I would fail every test. Ignoring information is a new skill to master. If we look at our evolution, once we would be walking in forest or savannah, and we would be paying close attention to every sound, sign and mark on the ground. More recently, for career and social life, paying attention could make the difference between belonging or exclusion. Now we walk along the street with our phones, partly somewhere else. The victory of the virtual.  At a work meeting recently, the leader of the meeting, the company owner, would stop whenever a message came in to write a quick response and the meeting would pause. This could have been annoying, but I decided simply to direct attention elsewhere for the duration and come back when the meeting resumed. It's an adaptation. I think how we adapt, individually and in groups, is the question for the path forwards. Which habits and perhaps which rules. Plenty of scope for cultural divergence!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

If social media are to exist , they must split themself up , into specialised sites , I know that we have a , much cherised , freedom of speak , but when I sometimes google something and end up at a primitive You Tube video , it turns me off the product , immidiately .When you study journalism , you are taught , that hidden advertising , is called prostitution work .If Social Media was devided into relevant sites , maybe even the young girls , would go out in the real world , instead of living their lives through bathroom photos .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "99982    At CES in 1995 I launched my product, Viewcall, as the world's first Internet on TV set-top box. Viewcall, which in 1997 was sold to Net Channel, a subsidiary of Oracle Corpn. It's impact helped destroy Microsoft's then intent to replace the Internet with its own channel.As a libertarian, my major intent was to offer a capability for people to connect to a purely political channel which had no agenda but on which debate could be fostered on local, national or international affairs sufficient for the public view to influence politicians. I also considered that national boundaries would slowly disappear as people of similar views and intellect globally grouped together to share them and spread their influence over and above politics.To an extent this happened but now we are starting to see Google dividing itself into national areas with a forecast by Alphabet Chairman that visas may soon be required for people to retrieve data across national boundaries. No doubt to satisfy the demands of the global PC brigade as well as undemocratic politicians. My experience in starting the first video rental business in the UK in 1980 should have taught me that politics is the least of the interests of most people well behind the best consumer sellers of entertainment, gossip, and pornography, when it comes to leisure time.So in short, people get what they want to get,and the consumer industries feed them until some momentous event or more like a fickle fancy substitutes new choice. People as whole are selfish unless survival forces community values on them and idealism is no more or less than the rainbow's end. My favorite idealist, the Elizabethan philosopher Francis Bacon (aka Shakespeare) and founder of the New World Order, on whom I have recently written a book The Royal Secret would be a sad man to know how far his Masonic guidelines adopted by the Founding Fathers have been so utterly abused by today's politicians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "99986    Fancy, it will be like having a huge library available at in instance by the push of a buttonAnd so it was. The village school teacher in deepest Uganda can, by using simple mobile phone technology, communicate with a much larger, more widely spread community of pupils, raising educational standards in out of the way places in a fraction of the time it took in days of non -IT communication. The exchange of knowledge accelerates, advancing mankind's development in a very positive way, in hitherto unexpected places. But Heaven and hell sit on opposite sides of the same coin. For those with aims of using, manipulating, controlling, deceiving a large global crowd, this is no longer happening at the village pump (think of a rhyme?) - just think, how overjoyed Hitler and henchmen would have been with THAT tool at their disposal. Couple this with a smarter way of spreading and mixing true with untrue 'news', confuse your listeners, divide them among themselves and soon you've got them, where you want them: too confused to clearly recognise your plans, powerless to organize any opposition, especially, if you manage to buy your way into global knowledge-exchange platforms. A very long way from 'innocent newspapering', which were controlled by some form of editing, traceable authorship and censorship (another double-edged sword).

Especially the opinions or beliefs based on no real evidence whatsoever?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "99993    I think a lot of the problems with mm, 'modern life', stems from the issue of value. How much do we value your coworker's effort, your overtime, the footballer's sweat. How much that value allows us to purchase. It doesn't interest me to work more than necessary when the structures of labour/payment are so skewed. I agree that it's an issue with capitalism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

However much one might dislike the fact that the UK is about to Brexit, suggesting it is in some way a national calamity that was enforced on an unsuspecting electorate by a dangerous man is laughable. There are pros and cons to being either inside or out of the EU. There was no status quo on offer, and Cameron's pitiful attempt to secure anything from the cloth-eared EU leadership hammered home that ever closer union was the direction of travel. With that in mind I believe wavering voters took one last look at what the EU was morphing into and opted out. It might not all be plain sailing, but the fact is that 168 other nation states are not in the EU but many are doing just fine. The losses from EU membership is, to some, offset by not being bound to an entity whose future vision they did not share, and therefore a reasonable price to pay for the UK leaving.</td>\n",

       "83873  How much the right wing media has had to do with Brexit and Trump is very difficult to assess. Fear mongering, race baiting, slandering educated liberally inclined people, attacking trades unions, demanding lower taxes go way, way back, in fact right back into the 19th century. Liberals have long complained of it. The US and UK, for my whole lifetime which is now coming to its inglorious close, have always had a very active gutter press &amp; colourful quasi-fascist personalities making disproportionately loud noises. Do they matter?

       "83881  Dacre is an extremely rich journalist. So is Murdoch and his henchmen. The BBC and ITV are stuffed full of extremely/obscenely well paid administrators and journalists and simple news readers on vast sums. We are not going to get what is best for ordinary people from any of these. The slightest hint of the overpaid actually paying over 45% income tax (or indeed at all), and they are going to fight like a wounded tiger against the best interests of the public using every means at their disposal, of which they have ample supply. They'll use the idiot-stand parroting of nonsensical soundbytes, the lies of politicians (the one this morning about housing for all being the usual baseless bollocks that has been fed to mugs for the past 40 years) and plenty of sex sells sleaze to wind in the punters like an angler winds in a small trout. And all the time, NO-ONE, especially the government, running ads for getting people to register to vote, nor of voting. I was even told by a friend who is a clerk to a Parish Council that everyone in her area has received their voting cards in a Tory run area. If the voters turf up to where they've been told to, they'll find an old couple trying to turn them away from their semi. If you want cock-ups beyond your worst nightmares, vote Tory.   \n",

       "83892  Forgive me, but the piece above is simply a mirror image of what appears in the Mail. Like it or not, by a whisker a majority voted to leave the EU. Yet reading this piece you would think the whole referendum had somehow been fixed. Granted the referendum should never have been called (and was only called to get David Cameron out of a fix, which it didn't). And granted that for every Leave voter who at the end of the day did not have a clue what he was voting for, I suggest there was a similar number of Remainers who also didn't have a clue. But the fact remains that a majority voted to leave, and the Guardian can bleat on about it till the cows come home (and I agree with the paper that economically it might well be a small disaster), but that isn't going to change. And a when we all sign up to the principle of abiding by the majority decision, we can't then turn around - as many Remainers do - and try to rule the result out of court because it wasn't the result they wanted. I was never a great fan of 'one rule for you, another for us'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "84419  Sure, Dacre's part of it, but the political imbalance in the MSM runs through the beast like a virus, from the blatant to the complete bollocks, and I'd include the Guardian in the shifting of furniture to the Right. The character assassination of Corbyn, which began with his leadership victory and has continued unabated has been the most systemic and prolonged attack on someone since I became aware of politics. It's way beyond what happened to Michael Foot.  And hey, you guys are part of it!  You might not be as prideful of your place as Dacre, but there must be a little puffing of the chest up there at Guardian Towers as May's rolls her reactionary forces onto your front lawn.

However, I do know a fair number of journalists and he certainly shares many of their qualities.

I'm apolitical to the maximum and do not allow myself to be influenced by any political schtick; my attitude is very much along the lines of a plague on all your houses (to misquote Mercutio).  I read across the spectrum of our press and some of the quality French and German press too. Much of the Daily Mail's journalism stands favourable comparison with most of the rest. It's interesting that when you look about the number of complaints about newspapers, the Daily Mail has very few by comparison to most of the rest. Much of the press is left-leaning and this analysis reflects that. People are entitled to their opinions and this is an op-ed which isn't a dispassionate analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

However much one might dislike the fact that the UK is about to Brexit, suggesting it is in some way a national calamity that was enforced on an unsuspecting electorate by a dangerous man is laughable. There are pros and cons to being either inside or out of the EU. There was no status quo on offer, and Cameron's pitiful attempt to secure anything from the cloth-eared EU leadership hammered home that ever closer union was the direction of travel. With that in mind I believe wavering voters took one last look at what the EU was morphing into and opted out. It might not all be plain sailing, but the fact is that 168 other nation states are not in the EU but many are doing just fine. The losses from EU membership is, to some, offset by not being bound to an entity whose future vision they did not share, and therefore a reasonable price to pay for the UK leaving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Some people, however, just can't help themselves from wanting these sorts of horrors to change, and therefore do shout about it.  As for your your remark about being selective: a) How do you know people don't campaign on more than one cause? and b) So what if they do only campaign on one thing? Trying to change something that's wrong is better than not trying to change anything that's wrong.

       "95815  I love the fact that the this Guardian piece makes no comment on the truth or otherwise of the mail's claims about Gary's tax affairs. I'd be amazed if GL isn't making use of the same kind of perfectly legal but morally dubious tax arrangements that the Guardian routinely (rightly) complains about. The fact that this article is purely of the look how horrible the Mail is being to lovely Gary variety makes it click-bait pure and simple (and it works well as 762 of us and counting have commented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "95819  Sure.  Personally i think these film partnerships are pretty dodgy. But in my book any moral negatives attaching to that are more than cancelled out for by his courage and decency standing up to the hysterical hatred and xenophobia of the likes of the Daily Hate. And many times over. More power to him.  On the other side I'm struggling to think what offsets the Daily Hate's relentless propagation of bigotry, hatred, racism, and intimidation of all who disagree with hypocrite Dacre's (he of the EU funded Scottish lodge) sociopathic world view.

       "95838  [ My advice to all you terribly depressed lovely people is to calm down, get a grip and stop telling eachother what a dark place (bottom lip trembling) the world has become. ] Well, thank you. I'll bear in mind how little some things matter: sick people having to fight tooth and nail for benefits to keep them from starving; people dying on trolleys in A&amp;E; poor people unfairly dismissed having no recourse to Legal Aid; rape crisis shelters closing due to lack of funding; councils unable to home homeless people, etc. And obviously not worth shouting about and trying to change either, according to your world view. Some people, however, just can't help themselves from wanting these sorts of horrors to change, and therefore do shout about it.  As for your your remark about being selective: a) How do you know people don't campaign on more than one cause? and b) So what if they do only campaign on one thing? Trying to change something that's wrong is better than not trying to change anything that's wrong. If you've made a decision to accept all the injustices, well ok, but why condemn those who want to try to make the world a better place?   \n",

On the other, I follow @DMreporter on twitter, and he or she isn't short of eyewateringly awful people. I'm not sure it's possible to just ignore it - I never spread things written in the Mail myself, but people will, and so others probably need to address that. It's really positive that Wikipedia have dispensed with it as a credible news source though - that says quite a lot, and in a low key way will pass on the message to millions about just how dodgy it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

This is how it workef Step 1 an individual invests £10k into a BES. Step 2 the individual then claimd£4k in tax relief on the £10k investment.Step 3 the BES then loans the individual £8k You never have to pay back the loan, they write it off and you never get investment back. So you lose £10k investment but gain £12k (8k from the non repayable loan and 4k in tax relief) leaving you up with £2k profit in a single day with no investment risk. The company owning the BES also makes £2k profit, it's just the poor tax payer who loses out. Hope that makes sense as an example of an aggresive tax avoidance scheme</td>\n",

       "96169  I can give you an example of an aggresive tax avoidance used in the 1990s, until the Government stopped them. It was the Business Enterprise Scheme BES, it was set to encourage investment into business but quickly became a tax loop hole. It only worked for high tax payers. This is how it workef Step 1 an individual invests £10k into a BES. Step 2 the individual then claimd£4k in tax relief on the £10k investment.Step 3 the BES then loans the individual £8k You never have to pay back the loan, they write it off and you never get investment back. So you lose £10k investment but gain £12k (8k from the non repayable loan and 4k in tax relief) leaving you up with £2k profit in a single day with no investment risk.

If government revenues were spent on useful things I guess there might be, but there is nothing wrong with a general disinclination to fund useless and expensive weapons systems; multi million dollar customised IT projects which, even when they work, could have been bought off the shelf for a fraction of the price; lining the pockets of consultants; bailing out failed banks who use the money to reward themselves for their incompetence with bonuses and salary increases...The list is endless and any one item on it provides instant justification for tax avoidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              92883431         2017-02-09 18:18:28  0.0    \n",

      "95924  1241        23789      92888394   Great explanation, thanks for sharing. I'm just thinking through the story today.  I suppose I don't 100% understand the no investment objective line. If saving for a retirement is an agreed objective for the British Govt, is a dubious tax minimisation scheme not just another way for extremely wealthy people to save for their own retirement? The objective the same, but just on a bigger scale than the average joe? Presuming that's what someone like Gary Lineker might've done. Thinking he's earned a lot as a player and broadcaster, then used the correct legal tax framework to save up as much as possible for his retirement or family?  Genuinely curious as to where the distinction lies - e.g. what can be saved for buying a house and what can't.

      "95883  1241        22509      92887438   A normal worker will pay 11% NI on his earnings. Above a certain amount NI is reduced almost to zero. As a freelance the BBC pay no NI for linekar despite the fact he's employed by them! And in many cases NI isn't paid on 2nd and 3rd paid work.

      "95975  1241        25460      92888401   Who's hooraying that? It's unproven so far and reads like a typical Mail smear. Haven't seen any one defending tax dodging by Lineker or anyone else (though the Mail certainly has when it's suited them). All I've seen on here is people decrying the vicious - and grossly hypocritical - bullying tactics of the Mail. So be clear, you know the reasons the Mail is attacking Lineker.

      "96582  1241        5071       92886592   These are good points. On the one hand, I've known at least four fundamentally lovely people whov've read the Mail for exactly these reasons, and not because they are bigots. On the other, I follow @DMreporter on twitter, and he or she isn't short of eyewateringly awful people. I'm not sure it's possible to just ignore it - I never spread things written in the Mail myself, but people will, and so others probably need to address that. It's really positive that Wikipedia have dispensed with it as a credible news source though - that says quite a lot, and in a low key way will pass on the message to millions about just how dodgy it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   92882193         2017-02-09 18:39:27  1.0    \n",

The scheme that Gary has been involved in is an elaborate and expensive tax avoidance scheme that only the very wealthy use to pay a lesser percentage tax on their income than the rest of us. It MAY be legal but it isn't moral.  This isn't a football match you know when we all shout for a penalty because it's our player that's gone down in the box despite him taking a dive.  It's perfectly reasonable to like Gary's stance on many issues, to dislike the Mail's stance on many issues at the same time as not liking this tax dodging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       92885679         2017-02-09 19:00:17  1.0    \n",

      "96342  1241        31500      92885254   I didn't say tax evasion, I said tax avoidance. It's all very well saying that it's legal and it well might be but it's not moral is it and if Call Me Dave was doing it we would all rightfully condemn him.  Neither is it an excuse to support Gary in his tax dodging just because the paper attacking him is owned by one of the country's leading tax dodgers. Let's by all means point out the irony but blind support for Gary is just my enemy's enemy is my friend.  This isn't like putting one's extra cash into an ISA or a pension. It's an expensive tax avoidance scheme set up for the very rich to pay much less tax than the rest of us and simply isn't fair. The man on the Clapham omnibus wouldn't be able to partake in such a scheme.  It's easy to say no to these things. I have run successful and very profitable companies for years and my very expensive accountants have always tried to persuade me to invest in one iffy scheme after another. I just said no, paid my tax and was very grateful that I still earned a whole lot more than almost everyone else I knew.

      "96281  1241        31482      92886775   Talking of being registered in another country for tax purposes.... Now, I can think of three possible explanations. First, they either didn’t know or had forgotten about the Guardian Media Group’s use of a tax-exempt shell company in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying corporation tax when it sold its 50 per cent holding in Auto Trader to Apax Partners in 2008 (hat tip to Guido Fawkes). Further, they were similarly ignorant about the hundreds of millions GMG has invested in offshore hedge funds over the years. But that seems unlikely. After all, right-wing hacks like me lose no opportunity to draw attention to the paper’s creative tax affairs, particularly when confronted with self-righteous columnists like Owen Jones and Polly Toynbee wagging their fingers at Vodafone and Starbucks for avoiding paying their ‘fair share’. http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/will-the-guardian-now-investigate-its-own-tax-arrangements/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 92886483         2017-02-09 18:42:49  2.0    \n",

      "96492  1241        31571      92885055   To look at the comments on this story all I can think is: all is lost. On the one hand a bunch of thick fascists, defending a paper that has long been discredited due to being a beacon of prejudice and hate, blissfully unaware that they've long since been indoctrinated. On the other side, a bunch of people so hopelessly browbeaten by the continued rise of a rabid Right that they are now prepared to defend the morally indefensible (though I strongly caveat that statement by adding that the real villains here are the accountants who have colluded with government to write the current ridiculous tax laws we have in this country). Depressing, but completely unsurprising.

It'd mean more if the moralistic band wagon he's obviously on was a bit closer to home, and by fuck there's a lot of choice! Impoverished children, the lack of care for the old, children in care and the homeless. Many people are sick to death of seeing already extremely well paid high profile people earning even more for advertising etc. And no one can convince me otherwise when you earn that much then you'll have employed the services of advisors. Everyone pays their taxes in full doesn't mean they pay a fair share of their earnings. The fact that it's hit a raw nerve with the pillock he's reacted in the same way he's over reacted to fashionable issues. We can all sit behind a smart device and moralise about the failure of govt to do what you wish them to do. That's a cop out because what the fuck do you do in stopping the wrongs you falsely feel so strongly about? Jack shit. As for the daily fucking mail? Fuck me if you let them get to you then your fucking ego is fragile.

Until then.. it's just an attack by the Mail who are trying to prove they can take him down. They need it to be clear that they are in charge. No point owning a lynch mob otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    92885254         2017-02-09 18:42:13  3.0    \n",

      "96341  1241        31500      92885448   I'm astounded at most of the comments on this matter in the Guardian.  Gary has been avoiding tax. There's no kinder way to say that and it's not good despite his superb support for many of the causes that we all also support. It's all very well saying that it's legal and it well might be but it's not moral is it and if Call Me Dave was doing it we would all rightfully condemn him. Neither is it an excuse to support Gary in his tax dodging just because the paper attacking him is owned by one of the country's leading tax dodgers. Let's by all means point out the irony but blind support for Gary is just my enemy's enemy is my friend. This isn't like putting one's extra cash into an ISA or a pension. It's an expensive tax avoidance scheme set up for the very rich to pay much less tax than the rest of us and simply isn't fair. The man on the Clapham omnibus wouldn't be able to partake in such a scheme. It's easy to say no to these things. I have run successful and very profitable companies for years and my very expensive accountants have always tried to persuade me to invest in one iffy scheme after another. I just said no, paid my tax and was very grateful that I still earned a whole lot more than almost everyone else I knew.

      "96169  1241        31435      92889393   I can give you an example of an aggresive tax avoidance used in the 1990s, until the Government stopped them. It was the Business Enterprise Scheme BES, it was set to encourage investment into business but quickly became a tax loop hole. It only worked for high tax payers. This is how it workef Step 1 an individual invests £10k into a BES. Step 2 the individual then claimd£4k in tax relief on the £10k investment.Step 3 the BES then loans the individual £8k You never have to pay back the loan, they write it off and you never get investment back. So you lose £10k investment but gain £12k (8k from the non repayable loan and 4k in tax relief) leaving you up with £2k profit in a single day with no investment risk. The company owning the BES also makes £2k profit, it's just the poor tax payer who loses out.

But in my book any moral negatives attaching to that are more than cancelled out for by his courage and decency standing up to the hysterical hatred and xenophobia of the likes of the Daily Hate. And many times over. More power to him.  On the other side I'm struggling to think what offsets the Daily Hate's relentless propagation of bigotry, hatred, racism, and intimidation of all who disagree with hypocrite Dacre's (he of the EU funded Scottish lodge) sociopathic world view.

      "96386  1241        31518      92887076   Strictly, tax avoidance is legal, and does include any scheme or structure designed to (legally) minimise tax liability. So yes, it includes pension contributions, salary sacrifice schemes, ISAs and the rest. Tax evasion, on the other hand, is the use of any scheme or structure designed to illegally minimise tax liability. For example, 'forgetting' to declare income.  Moaning about people doing the former is hypocritical in the extreme, unless you want to start a conversation about what level of avoidance is the correct moral cut off between 'it's OK, we all do it,' and 'you bastard, you earn more money than me and should therefore live to a different moral standard than I do.' Moaning about the latter is, frankly, entirely justified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           92885077         2017-02-09 18:48:22  5.0    \n",

      "96542  1241        31606      92882193   Can't all the other media outlets just ignore the extremist media, like the Mail and Murdoch owned stuff. Before Twitter that's exactly what happened. I remember staunch socialists telling me they bought the Mail to better understand what the enemy were thinking (and, I suspect, for the excellent magazine sections).  These days no-one buys papers, but the internet is constantly reporting the BS in these extremist rags. A large segment of the readership are just people who like gossip, so do we give the Mail more credit than they're due. The girl sitting next to me at work spends all day perusing their celebrity news and I know she's oblivious, and ambivalent, to the horrors to be found elsewhere.  Let's stop giving them oxygen.

      "96167  1241        31433      92883222   Fully behind multi millionaire Gary Lineker right to defend issues. He has every right to defend fellow multi millionaire David Beckham over his insistence that children's charities, that support the most poverty stricken children in the world , must provide him with his expenses and first class travel if he is too help. Do people think he is a charity, he owes these children nothing, so if by his good grace he is going to help these charities should pay. Gary has every right to defend his friend that has been attacked by the wicked press, just as Gary was attacked by the press when they correctly reported that Gary was involved in systematic tax avoidance. What's wrong with people it's only the  bankers that do things like that, celebrities would never do anything bad, they just care for other people.

So presumably the Daily Mail reader audience have a problem with anyone who stands up for other people who espouse values they themselves do not possess.

It appears to refer to the late Lord Rothermere's second wife, Maiko Lee, of Korean nationality. She did not respond to our invitations to comment. Rothermere's son Jonathan by his first wife inherited the Daily Mail, also through a Jersey trust, and a Bermuda-registered offshore entity. Jonathan is estimated to be worth £760m.

      "95887  1241        22530      92886112   Correct sir, and just to remind us: Adolf Hitler letter to Lord Rothermere (7th December, 1933)I should like to express the appreciation of countless Germans, who regard me as their spokesman, for the wise and beneficial public support which you have given to a policy that we all hope will contribute to the enduring pacification of Europe. Just as we are fanatically determined to defend ourselves against attack, so do we reject the idea of taking the initiative in bringing about a war. I am convinced that no one who fought in the front trenches during the world war, no matter in what European country, desires another conflict.  Lord Rothermere, telegram to Adolf Hitler (1st October, 1938)My dear Fuhrer everyone in Englandmn is profoundly moved by the bloodless solution to the Czechoslovakian problem. People not so much concerned with territorial readjustment as with dread of another war with its accompanying bloodbath. Frederick the Great was a great popular figure.

      "96061  1241        2868       92885397   [ Among the views expressed by Lineker with which the Mail appears to take issue are his portrait of Brexit Britain as a “dystopian land”, his opinion that public attitudes to refugees can be “hideously racist and utterly heartless”, his take on Nigel Farage as “disgusting” and Iain Duncan Smith as an “irritable dunce”.  Lineker’s stance against the politics of Donald Trump, the far right and the Front National French presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, are also listed as examples of his position on the “moral high ground”. ] If the 'moral high ground' is considered an insult by the paper that supported actual real Nazis and still does, then good. I'm with Lineker here and I'd consider a hatchet job by a fucking rag like the Mail a badge of honour. Shows how worried they are of dissent against their authoritarian, racist worldview.

      "96365  1241        31507      92887609   Straight from the dumb, bully boy playbook: when outsmarted or irked by an opponent, close him down by impugning his character in a effort to invalidate what he has to say. The Daily Heil is a rag that seems to prefer making or faking the news, rather than reporting it and focuses on provoking the most visceral human reactions to stories. The DM's preferred angle being that of Fortress UK as beacon of hope, righteousness &amp; rectitude that all these dreadful Johnny foreigners are trying to invade, stealing our jobs &amp; women and illegally scrounging off our generous benefits system etc. In short, the DM never knowing lets anything as unexciting as facts and truth get in the way of a blood-vessel rupturing headline.  As the BBC was recently obliged to publicise salaries of those earning over a certain amount and as Mr Lineker is a freelance who will no doubt be billing them for his services, he will have to do this via a company which will have audited accounts. If the DM believes he has a case to answer, then fair enough, run a story. But this is not what their hatchet job is about, it is to shutdown the debate on the increasingly naked intolerance and scapegoating of the 'other' that is poisoning the political discourse in the U.K. Lineker has the misfortune to be everything they loathe: decent, fair, talented and not afraid to call out the racism, xenophobia, lies and bullying. Someone having oh so right-on views is no crime but if it irks the author of the DM hatchet-job article and makes him uncomfortable (poor snowflake!), then the fault lies with him, NOT Gary Lineker.

They are the hypocrites with their ability to reach millions (biggest selling newspaper and world's largest online readership) and yet, to satisfy their own political views they persist in trying to take down an individual whose views and statements don't agree with theirs. Well boo ya, Dacre, Rothermere and Katie Hopkins (to name but three) - your problem is this: We all know what YOU are - and a lot of us don't like you for it. It's obviously hard to stick to principles when you don't have any moral fibre Dacre. No one will miss you when you finally skulk off to some corner of your imaginary Britain.

      "95862  1241        21941      92884741   The DM supports its own interests first and foremost. Its owners are tax avoiders of the highest order yet it published articles about other people tax affairs in the hope of misinforming readers and generally keeping the hate alive.

No bigger echo chamber than the sad fucks who read the Mail and actually believe the shite thats written in it.

      "96467  1241        31553      92885129   During the past few months, the Daily Mail seems to have crossed a line. It has always been a poisonous and emetic right wing rag which befouled public life and played a major role in promoting political and actual illiteracy in our country. It did not however, seriously attempt to gag opinions with which its editor and owners disagreed. Now, however something new and disturbing has crept into its house style, an attempt to silence public debate and create a totalitarian unity of thought, the smearing and intimidation of anyone with whom it takes issue and, by constant repetition, a concerted effort to create a mindset which excludes anyone who disagrees from the nation as a whole - remember enemies of the people - ? There are ominous signs that this is working: you only have to read below the line, not only in the Mail itself, but in this newspaper as well to se that there are very many people who do not regard themselves as participants in a national debate on Britain's place in the world, but as warriors in a battle with those whom they perceive as enemies, traitors and threats to the national wellbeing. Even more disturbing is that this syndrome has infected both the executive and legislature: is it conceivable that even a year ago the government would have been able to state and Parliament accept that, on the most crucial issue to face our country since 1945, one on which public opinion is literally split down the middle, no discussion or modification is possible?  Because of the toxic atmosphere that the Daily Mail has created, our political leaders from left to right have bought into the concept that seeking to properly represent the nation and actively considering its well being is somehow undemocratic or even treasonable. We are well on the way to the kind of stultifying situation where even thinking the wrong way is treated - and accepted - as almost criminal and with the increasing isolation of our country this can only get worse. In medical terms, the Daily Mail has changed from a purulent boil to a malignant tumour and it is metastasizing through the body politic.  NaN              2017-02-09 18:09:42  33.0   \n",

      "96524  1241        31594      92883698   Ever since Brexit I've been trying to get my head round what is happening to this country and I think I understand now. There is a belligerence about the far right, I don't know if it's always been like that or if I'm just noticing it now. The ability to scream I'm not listening in the face or a calm, reasonable rebuttal and live your life in a state of cynicism. Everyone is awful, so why should I hate immigrants, gay people, ethnic minorities. We need more people like Gary Lineker but we also need to take it a step further. We need to call out these disgusting, knuckle-dragging racists and tell them exactly what they are. I'm sick of agreeing to disagree and ignoring what is clear as day. If you buy the Daily Mail you condone racism, homophobia and fascism. I don't care what you say.

      "95916  1241        23750      92888485   Yes, there's absolutely no reason why anyone can't legally arrange their affairs to reduce the amount of tax they might otherwise be liable for. As was said by the judge in the Duke of Westminster case in 1936, which is neatly summarised here:  [ Every man is entitled if he can to arrange his affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure that result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax. ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            92884544         2017-02-09 19:14:52  37.0   \n",

      "95968  1241        25056      92887397   The mail talkling about tax, feck me. Let me refresh your memories. Rothermere, just all his family before him, are non-doms to avoid taxation, he loves this country so much he fecked off to France to live. Of course, being a billionaire and owning property there, he knows that even after Brexit that he campaigned for, he will have no problems going to Europe and back whenever he wants. The Daily Mail itself is owned through a series of shell companies, at least 6, all offshore, but ultimately, the ownership of the Daily Mail as a corporate entity is situated in Bermuda, again to avoid tax. The much vaunted website of the Daily Mail is not British either, being headquartered in New York.

      "96046  1241        27843      92885737   Lineker does present a real problem for the Mail, as he was a footballer of the highest order, and Mail readers love football. He's also well-informed, speaks well and can be quite funny. Unlike the 'liberal elite' that they can hate as being distant from their readers, he's the type of person that they might listen to, and thus he is a danger to their xenophobic, bigoted, right wing, narrative with its base in ignorance and bigotry..A politician or actor they can paint as different from the readership, but a footballer? That's not an easy thing to do, so going overboard with lies and accusations is the only way to go.

It's that simple.

I'll bear in mind how little some things matter: sick people having to fight tooth and nail for benefits to keep them from starving; people dying on trolleys in A&amp;E; poor people unfairly dismissed having no recourse to Legal Aid; rape crisis shelters closing due to lack of funding; councils unable to home homeless people, etc. And obviously not worth shouting about and trying to change either, according to your world view. Some people, however, just can't help themselves from wanting these sorts of horrors to change, and therefore do shout about it.  As for your your remark about being selective: a) How do you know people don't campaign on more than one cause? and b) So what if they do only campaign on one thing? Trying to change something that's wrong is better than not trying to change anything that's wrong. If you've made a decision to accept all the injustices, well ok, but why condemn those who want to try to make the world a better place?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                92886815         2017-02-09 19:01:02  92.0   \n",

An assault on free speech.

      "96451  1241        31544      92886062   To be honest, it's hard to take anything seriously when it emanates from the Mail.  From the Zinoviev telegram and its support for 'Herr Hitler' and 'Signor Mussolini ' to its recent support for climate change deniers it has a long and undistinguished history of supporting extremists. It's a populist propaganda sheet for wealthy elites, a distillation of all that's tawdry in human prejudices. It's sense of priorities is such that it devotes two pages to attacking an ex-footballer who commentates on TV - there is so much else it could devote its editorial talents to. Regardless of the rights and wrongs of Linekers tax arrangements, that's not why it's focussed on him - it's attack is purely based on a dislike for his political views.  For the Mail that's all the excuse they need to ignore the forest in their own eyes, whilst they pick at splinters in the eyes of those they disagree with. Rothermere, Murdoch and the Barclay Brothers, with such stellar champions of the common man holding sway on our media organs there is no need for fake news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   92882524         2017-02-09 18:28:19  251.0  \n",

      "95982  1241        25544      92881738   Yes it is rather ironic that the Daily Mail is accusing him of not paying taxes when the Mail's billionaire owner Lord Rothermere and its multi millionaire editor Paul Dacre are both non dom tax avoiders.

There's no such dog as a Kelly Blue; it's a Kerry Blue and it's not British, it's Irish. Speaking of which, the wonderful Irish water spaniel is also in deep doo-doo.  If I had the various resources needed to do so, I'd love to breed all these wonderful dogs myself just to keep them going. However, I'd also need the resources to take on one rescue dog for every pedigree as I'd feel bad if I didn't. It'd be a mammoth task but if I ever get a publisher for that potentially best-selling children's book, that's then turned into a film, accompanied by loads of merchandise, followed by more books and films of the same that make me filthy stinking rich in a JK Rowling stylee... that's the project for me.

However, you may have to trade off something else. If you have a normal 9-5 employer, then they have effectively decided you can't play during that time. Unless they offer you some sort of works team, in which case, again they have decided for you that you can do it if you feel like it. Similarly, a spouse may well not be happy with 24-7 football-playing aspirations! I don't have the stuff he mentions frame a lot of decisions (family, spouse, employer et al) and some other constraints that can drive decision making (e.g. no mortgage). I certainly feel I am endlessly taking decisions and wonder if it might actually be better to have more constraints just to remove some of this constant what next. I've been doing it today big time and I actually though of that reference he mentioned - it often can feel like the road less travelled for a variety of reasons. However, it can also create its own resentment too of course, of those you feel are having it easier by not having to do it!

Wilful ignorance is one of the greatest dangers faced by human society in the 21st century, and when combined with a needy clinging to 'strong', authoritarian governments, leads to utter disaster. We saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, as Europeans chose to embrace ludicrous ideologies - in this case, fantasies of ethnic and national superiority - and the right-wing governments that peddled them. Despite these potent lessons, the same thing seems to be happening all over again. People are terrified - mostly because of what their governments are doing to them (damaging ordinary people in order to keep the rich in clover), but instead of seeing that for what it is, and holding the governments to account, they submissively accept all the nonsense promulgated by the government. People who constantly act against their own interests in preference to thinking for themselves are horrifying - from poor Americans opposing universal healthcare to the nutter Brits who think that the public sector, people on benefits and single mothers are collectively responsible for a global economic meltdown. And the general refusal to act on the overwhelming scientific evidence that we're at the very brink of climate disaster - just because the govt doesn't take it seriously - is shocking.</td>\n",

       "1773   Bad news indeed but I'm afraid I need to point out a couple of errors, one small, one glaring: It's Dandy Dinmont, not dimont. There's no such dog as a Kelly Blue; it's a Kerry Blue and it's not British, it's Irish. Speaking of which, the wonderful Irish water spaniel is also in deep doo-doo.  If I had the various resources needed to do so, I'd love to breed all these wonderful dogs myself just to keep them going. However, I'd also need the resources to take on one rescue dog for every pedigree as I'd feel bad if I didn't. It'd be a mammoth task but if I ever get a publisher for that potentially best-selling children's book, that's then turned into a film, accompanied by loads of merchandise, followed by more books and films of the same that make me filthy stinking rich in a JK Rowling stylee... that's the project for me.

       "2106   Brussels sprouts are supposed to be a tad bitter - can we please have an end to this constant campaign to try to make them into something they're not?

But then I'm not interested in having sex with anyone I fancy who's unattached if they're not equally delighted and enthusiastic about the prospect of having sex with me, Cut your losses and move on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "6507   oldprof, extremes are a straw man. No you won't be an international footballer. But you can in theory choose how many times you play a week. However, you may have to trade off something else. If you have a normal 9-5 employer, then they have effectively decided you can't play during that time. Unless they offer you some sort of works team, in which case, again they have decided for you that you can do it if you feel like it. Similarly, a spouse may well not be happy with 24-7 football-playing aspirations! I don't have the stuff he mentions frame a lot of decisions (family, spouse, employer et al) and some other constraints that can drive decision making (e.g. no mortgage). I certainly feel I am endlessly taking decisions and wonder if it might actually be better to have more constraints just to remove some of this constant what next. I've been doing it today big time and I actually though of that reference he mentioned - it often can feel like the road less travelled for a variety of reasons. However, it can also create its own resentment too of course, of those you feel are having it easier by not having to do it! Particularly perhaps if you would like to have some of those containing factors but have not got them. I have to work really, really hard to manage that too.                               \n",
       "6508   Interesting, if not very surprising. Wilful ignorance is one of the greatest dangers faced by human society in the 21st century, and when combined with a needy clinging to 'strong', authoritarian governments, leads to utter disaster. We saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, as Europeans chose to embrace ludicrous ideologies - in this case, fantasies of ethnic and national superiority - and the right-wing governments that peddled them. Despite these potent lessons, the same thing seems to be happening all over again. People are terrified - mostly because of what their governments are doing to them (damaging ordinary people in order to keep the rich in clover), but instead of seeing that for what it is, and holding the governments to account, they submissively accept all the nonsense promulgated by the government. People who constantly act against their own interests in preference to thinking for themselves are horrifying - from poor Americans opposing universal healthcare to the nutter Brits who think that the public sector, people on benefits and single mothers are collectively responsible for a global economic meltdown. And the general refusal to act on the overwhelming scientific evidence that we're at the very brink of climate disaster - just because the govt doesn't take it seriously - is shocking.   \n",

       "97216  Even Mcconaughey, why are southern men drawn to fascism is it just that they all grew up with bigot fathers? His movies have become terrible, he is losing his looks, maybe he thinks he can make more money sucking up to NASCAR crowd and the animals that elected Trump. Sorry, Matt in the real world the guy you think should be embraced is having his officials bar US residents with green cards at the border based on religious bigotry. I hope he gets blackballed and goes bankrupt worse than Depp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Wilful ignorance is one of the greatest dangers faced by human society in the 21st century, and when combined with a needy clinging to 'strong', authoritarian governments, leads to utter disaster. We saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, as Europeans chose to embrace ludicrous ideologies - in this case, fantasies of ethnic and national superiority - and the right-wing governments that peddled them. Despite these potent lessons, the same thing seems to be happening all over again. People are terrified - mostly because of what their governments are doing to them (damaging ordinary people in order to keep the rich in clover), but instead of seeing that for what it is, and holding the governments to account, they submissively accept all the nonsense promulgated by the government. People who constantly act against their own interests in preference to thinking for themselves are horrifying - from poor Americans opposing universal healthcare to the nutter Brits who think that the public sector, people on benefits and single mothers are collectively responsible for a global economic meltdown. And the general refusal to act on the overwhelming scientific evidence that we're at the very brink of climate disaster - just because the govt doesn't take it seriously - is shocking.</td>\n",

During the liberation of Paris she photographed Picasso and many other figures of the art world, all friends from before the war. Contrary to army regulations she photographed combat on many occasions, being present at the siege of St Malo, and during the bitter fighting in the Vosges Mountains in the winter of 1944–5.

       "6508   Interesting, if not very surprising. Wilful ignorance is one of the greatest dangers faced by human society in the 21st century, and when combined with a needy clinging to 'strong', authoritarian governments, leads to utter disaster. We saw this in the 1930s and 1940s, as Europeans chose to embrace ludicrous ideologies - in this case, fantasies of ethnic and national superiority - and the right-wing governments that peddled them. Despite these potent lessons, the same thing seems to be happening all over again. People are terrified - mostly because of what their governments are doing to them (damaging ordinary people in order to keep the rich in clover), but instead of seeing that for what it is, and holding the governments to account, they submissively accept all the nonsense promulgated by the government. People who constantly act against their own interests in preference to thinking for themselves are horrifying - from poor Americans opposing universal healthcare to the nutter Brits who think that the public sector, people on benefits and single mothers are collectively responsible for a global economic meltdown. And the general refusal to act on the overwhelming scientific evidence that we're at the very brink of climate disaster - just because the govt doesn't take it seriously - is shocking.   \n",
       "17647  Whenever my finger wavers over the 'play' button on these 'How to dress' features, I am brought to a state of near unbearable excitement as I think... 'Yay! I can see a lady. She looks pretty stylish. She's going to tell us about how to combine this featured item with a bevvy of other pieces. This will create a hitherto unthought-of look, that we, the fashion ignoratti, have been missing out on. This is because we feel a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of what is on offer, each time we go into Zara/Topshop/M &amp; S. Praise be!' Or...' This lady is going to tell us some really interesting things about wearing this featured item. Something that will then educate us and may just stop us making a HUGE fashion faux pas. Something along the lines of: 'if you are a bit short-arsed and have big boobs, wearing this short, waterfall jacket is going to make you look like a total mono-boobed, chubster. Avoid please.' But then I remember that if I do press 'play', all I will see is this stylish lady having a whale of a time, prancing around getting her picture taken, fondling a few pieces on a hanger that we have already seen in the shops, before, swoon, telling us where we can get it.  Revelatory? Sadly... no.                                                                                                   \n",

       "23966  No mention here of Lee Miller (1907–1977). Could it be that photographers and photojournalists can still be considered to be somehow merely technician-tradesman. But she does get her rightful place in the Oxford DNB: it was for her features in Vogue that she was best known, particularly after D­day when, as an accredited war correspondent, she followed the advance of the American army across Europe. During the liberation of Paris she photographed Picasso and many other figures of the art world, all friends from before the war. Contrary to army regulations she photographed combat on many occasions, being present at the siege of St Malo, and during the bitter fighting in the Vosges Mountains in the winter of 1944–5.

       "26292  We too married after living together for 18 years (largely because we started to worry about what will happen to the other should one of us die - I suppose eventually these things creep up on you as you age and it's a lot simpler to protect the other if you are married). It was a very low key wedding with just very close family - in total we were a group of six. The ceremony took about 10 minutes but was extremely moving. And we had a lovely dinner afterwards. I haven't changed my name and our marriage is a private matter between the two of us. If we could have had a civil partnership and gained the same legal rights then we would have chosen that route. Marriage has made no discernible difference to our relationship. Maybe it has brought us a bit closer because it's just the natural next stage in our lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

It has almost become another stereo type. But at least it makes a change from sweet school girls and office ladies looking for a man. You know the best women’s film I saw this year was Lily Festival about a group of old ladies and arrival of the only man resident and the effect it has on the women. It was directed by a woman Sachi Hamano who is actually famous for soft porn films which has made about 400. It was a re-realse of a 2001 title.  It was a wonderful film.
